        Check if a line is a ready prompt (unit is ready to receive a new command).

        Oregon RFID devices prepend each serial output line with a
        4-character prompt signature describing the current device state.
        The format is positional and must be interpreted by character index:

            [0][1][2][3]
            |  |  |  |
            |  |  |  └─ Audible feedback state
            |  |  └──── Time synchronization source
            |  └────── Run / scan state
            └───────── Network / operating mode

        Character definitions:

        Character 1 = Operating mode:
            '0' : Off with power
            'H' : Host mode (generates system timing for network)
            'N' : Node mode (synchronized to host)

        Character 2 = Run state:
            'R' : Running; scanning enabled, detections saved to file
            'S' : Standby; not scanning, database accessible
            'Z' : Off

        Character 3 = Time synchronization:
            'G' : Synchronized to GNSS signals
            'N' : Synchronized to network signal
            'U' : Unsynchronized
            'E' : Elapsed time (no absolute timestamp)

        Character 4 = Beeper state:
            'B' : Beeper enabled
            '*' : Beeper disabled

        Validation rules:
            - Signature must be exactly 4 characters long
            - Each character must be valid for its position
            - The line must contain ONLY the signature (and optional '>') with nothing after
            - This indicates the unit is ready to receive a new command

        Example:
            "HRGB>" → valid (unit ready)
            "HRGB" → valid (unit ready)
            "HSU*> RFM009 ORMR ready" → invalid (has data after prompt)
            "HRGX>" → invalid (unknown beeper state)
            "HRG>" → invalid (wrong length)

        Parameters
        ----------
        line : str
            Full line from device (e.g. "HRGB>", "HSU*> data here").
